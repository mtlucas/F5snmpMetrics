# F5snmpMetrics

DevOps tooling to collect and display metrics scraped by Prometheus for F5 load balancers

Written in .Net 6.  AppSetting.json configures the app and SNMP targets.  Currently, this has some strict requirements due to having to declare Prometheus-Net objects.  Created issue, and looking for help.
